  "duration": "3 months",
  "overview": "The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies for building full-stack web applications using JavaScript. It consists of four components: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible JSON format, making it scalable and ideal for modern applications. Express.js is a backend framework for Node.js, handling HTTP requests and routing. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server side, enabling full-stack JavaScript development. React.js, a front-end library by Facebook, builds interactive user interfaces with reusable components. Together, these technologies allow developers to use a single language (JavaScript) across the entire application, streamlining development.",
