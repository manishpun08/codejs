  "overview": "JavaScript (JS) is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily utilized for the creation of interactive and dynamic content on websites. Operating within the browser environment, JavaScript enables developers to manipulate web page elements, handle events, and interact with application programming interfaces (APIs). As one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is indispensable for client-side scripting. TypeScript (TS), a superset of JavaScript, introduces static typing, thereby allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This feature aids in identifying errors during the development process, significantly enhancing code quality and maintainability.",
